I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Ruhr-University Bochum. I specialize in panel and network data econometrics. My previous work has advanced the computation of high-dimensional fixed effects estimators for non-linear panel data models. Moreover, I develop new econometric methods that are of particular interest for international trade. In my [most recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04073), I develop a debiased fixed effects estimator for binary logit models with three-dimensional panel data, where the model includes three sets of additive and overlapping unobserved effects.
